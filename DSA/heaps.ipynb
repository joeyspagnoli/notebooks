    "### Case Study 1: Kth Largest Element in a Stream (LeetCode 703/215)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:** Find the $k^{th}$ largest element in an unsorted array or a stream of numbers. For example, in `[3,2,1,5,6,4]` the 2nd largest is `5`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Suboptimal Approaches:**\n",
    "1.  **Sort:** Sort the array in descending order and pick the element at index `k-1`. Time: $O(N \\log N)$, Space: $O(1)$ or $O(N)$ depending on sort implementation.\n",
    "2.  **Max-Heap:** Build a max-heap from all $N$ elements ($O(N)$) and then pop $k$ times ($O(k \\log N)$). Total Time: $O(N + k \\log N)$, Space: $O(N)$. This is better if $k$ is small, but still requires storing all $N$ items.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Optimal Solution: A Min-Heap of Size K**\n",
    "\n",
    "The most efficient approach uses a clever inversion of logic. Instead of tracking all $N$ items, we only track the **top K largest items seen so far**. And the perfect tool to do this is a **min-heap of size exactly K**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Algorithm:**\n",
    "1.  Create an empty min-heap.\n",
    "2.  Iterate through the numbers. For each number `num`:\n",
    "    -   Push `num` onto the min-heap.\n",
    "    -   If the heap's size grows larger than $k$, pop the smallest element (the root).\n",
    "3.  After iterating through all numbers, the heap contains the $k$ largest elements. The root of the min-heap is the smallest of these, which is precisely the $k^{th}$ largest element overall.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis:**\n",
    "-   **Time:** We process $N$ elements. Each heap operation (push or pop) costs $O(\\log k)$ because the heap never grows larger than size $k$. Total time is **$O(N \\log k)$**.\n",
    "-   **Space:** The heap stores at most $k$ elements. Total space is **$O(k)$**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a massive improvement, especially for streaming data where $N$ is huge and you can't store everything!"

    "-   A **Priority Queue** is an abstract concept; a **Binary Heap** is its most efficient implementation, offering $O(\\log n)$ inserts and extracts.\n",
    "-   The magic of heaps comes from their **complete binary tree structure** which allows for a super-efficient **array representation**.\n",
    "-   The core mechanics are **percolating up** (for insertion) and **percolating down** (for deletion).\n",
    "-   When you see a problem asking for \"Top K\", \"smallest/largest\", or \"running median\", your mind should immediately jump to heaps.\n",
    "-   The **two-heap pattern** for finding medians is a powerful technique that elegantly splits a dataset into two manageable halves.\n",
