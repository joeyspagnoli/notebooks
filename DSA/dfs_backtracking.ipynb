    "### Intuition: The Maze Analogy\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you are navigating a vast, complex maze. To ensure you explore every passage, you might adopt the following strategy: upon reaching a junction with multiple paths, you choose one and follow it to its absolute end. If that end is the maze's exit, you have succeeded. If it is a dead end, you must retrace your steps (i.e., **backtrack**) to the last junction you were at and explore the next available, untried path.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the very essence of Depth-First Search. It prioritizes depth over breadth, committing to a single line of inquiry until it is fully resolved before systematically returning to explore other options. This methodical process guarantees that every reachable node or state will eventually be visited."

    "\n",
    "Unlike its counterpart, Breadth-First Search (BFS), which explores all neighbors at the present depth before moving to the next level, DFS ventures as far as possible down one branch. This behavior is naturally managed by a **stack** data structure, which operates on a Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) principle.\n",
    "\n",
    "The stack can be implemented in two primary ways:\n",
    "1.  **Implicitly (Recursion):** The most common and often most elegant implementation of DFS uses the program's **call stack**. Each recursive function call pushes a new frame onto the stack, representing a deeper level of traversal. When a base case is met or a path is exhausted, the function returns, popping its frame off the stack and effectively \"backtracking\" to the previous state.\n",
    "2.  **Explicitly (Iteration):** An iterative version of DFS can be built using an explicit stack data structure, such as a Python `list` or `collections.deque`. The algorithm starts by pushing the root node onto the stack. It then enters a loop that continues as long as the stack is not empty, where it pops a node, processes it, and pushes its unvisited neighbors onto the stack."

    "1.  **The Base Case (`is_a_solution`):** This is the termination condition for the recursion. It checks if the `current_state` (e.g., a path, a permutation, a filled grid) meets the problem's goal. If so, we record the solution and return, as there is no need to explore this path further.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **The Loop (`get_all_possible_choices`):** This loop generates all potential next steps from the `current_state`. The set of choices may be static (e.g., numbers 1-9 in Sudoku) or dynamic (e.g., remaining unused numbers for a permutation).\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Make the Choice (`make_choice`):** This is the action of committing to a choice. It involves updating our state variables. For example, adding an element to a list representing the current subset, or placing a number on a Sudoku board.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Recurse (`backtrack(...)`):** This is the heart of the depth-first exploration. We call the function on itself with the modified state, effectively descending one level deeper in the decision tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Undo the Choice (`undo_choice`):** This step is the defining feature of backtracking and is absolutely critical. After a recursive call returns (meaning it has fully explored all paths stemming from our last choice), we must revert the state to its previous condition. This is what allows us to explore the *next* choice in the loop from a clean slate. A common implementation is `path.pop()` if we added an element to a list."

    "- **Time Complexity: $O(N \\cdot 2^N)$**\n",
    "  - For each element in `nums`, we have two choices: either include it in the subset or not. This leads to a total of $2^N$ possible subsets.\n",
    "  - For each of these $2^N$ subsets, we create a copy of the `current_path` to add to our `results`. In the worst case, the path can have a length of $N$. \n",
    "  - Therefore, the total time complexity is dominated by the process of generating all $2^N$ subsets and copying them, resulting in $O(N \\cdot 2^N)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Space Complexity: $O(N)$**\n",
    "  - The primary contributor to the space complexity is the recursion call stack. The depth of the recursion is at most $N$, as we make one recursive call for each element we choose to include in the path.\n",
    "  - The `current_path` also stores at most $N$ elements.\n",
    "  - Therefore, the space required is proportional to $N$. (Note: This analysis excludes the space required for the output list `results`, which would be $O(N \\cdot 2^N)$.)"
