    "A simple iterative copy fails because when we create a new node, we don't know where its `random` pointer should point yet‚Äîthe node it's supposed to point to may not have been created. The optimal solution uses a hash map (dictionary in Python) to keep track of the relationship between old nodes and their new copies.\n",

    "2.  **Second Pass:** Iterate through the original list again. For each `old_node`, use the map to set the pointers of its copy. The `next` pointer of `new_node` is simply `map[old_node.next]`, and the `random` pointer is `map[old_node.random]`."

    "\n",
    "1.  **‚úèÔ∏è Draw It Out:** This cannot be overstated. Before writing a single line of code for a complex pointer manipulation problem, draw the nodes on a whiteboard or piece of paper. Trace how your pointers (`prev`, `curr`, `slow`, `fast`, etc.) move with each step. This will help you catch logical errors before they become bugs.\n",
    "2.  ** paranoid about Nulls:** The most common runtime error with linked lists is the dreaded null pointer exception (in Python, `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'next'`). Before you ever access `node.next`, you **must** be certain that `node` itself is not `None`. This is especially important in loops and conditions (e.g., `while fast and fast.next:`)."
