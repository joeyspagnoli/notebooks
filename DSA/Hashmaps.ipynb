    "\n",
    "In the landscape of data structures, the **Hash Map**—known as a `dictionary` in Python—stands out as arguably the most critical tool for a software engineer, particularly in the context of coding interviews. Its prevalence stems from a single, powerful capability: the ability to perform average-time **$O(1)$ complexity for lookups, insertions, and deletions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This constant-time performance allows for the creation of highly efficient algorithms that would otherwise be sluggish. Many brute-force solutions with quadratic complexity, such as $O(n^2)$, can often be optimized to linear time, $O(n)$, by the clever application of a hash map. This optimization is not just an incremental improvement; it is a fundamental shift in efficiency that separates a non-viable solution from a production-ready one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, it is essential to internalize the following critical thinking question. It should be the first thing you ask yourself when aiming to optimize a slow algorithm:\n",

    "## 2.2 ⚙️ Under the Hood: How Hashing Works\n",
    "\n",
    "To wield hash maps effectively, it is crucial to understand their internal mechanics. A hash map is a generalization of a standard array. While an array uses an integer index to access an element, a hash map allows you to use a key of almost any type (e.g., a string, a number, or a tuple) to find its corresponding value. This is achieved through three core components:"

    "### Hash Function\n",
    "A hash function is a mathematical function that takes a key as input and deterministically produces an integer output. This integer is the \"hash code.\" In the context of a hash map, this hash code is then mapped to an index within the underlying array.\n",
    "$$ \\text{index} = \\text{hash}(\\text{key}) \\pmod{M} $$\n",
    "Where $M$ is the size of the underlying array. A good hash function distributes keys uniformly across the available indices to minimize collisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Buckets\n",
    "The underlying data store for a hash map is an array. Each slot in this array is called a **bucket**. The index calculated by the hash function determines which bucket a key-value pair should be placed in.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Collision Resolution\n",
    "A **hash collision** occurs when two distinct keys produce the same hash code, and thus map to the same bucket index. Since two items cannot occupy the same single slot, a strategy is needed to handle this. The most common method is **Chaining**.\n",
    "\n",
    "With chaining, each bucket, instead of holding a single value, holds a pointer to another data structure, typically a linked list. If multiple keys map to the same bucket, their key-value pairs are simply appended to the linked list at that index. When retrieving a value, the hash map first finds the correct bucket and then traverses the linked list, comparing the given key with the keys stored in the list until a match is found.\n",

    "## 2.3 💡 Common Problem Pattern: Finding Duplicates & Pairs\n",
    "\n",
    "The $O(1)$ lookup capability of a hash map makes it exceptionally well-suited for problems that involve searching for items. This includes detecting duplicates, finding pairs that satisfy a specific condition, or, more generally, checking for the existence of an element in a collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "A classic example is the **\"Two Sum\"** problem (LeetCode 1): given an array of integers `nums` and a target integer `target`, find the indices of two numbers such that they add up to `target`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A naive, brute-force approach would use nested loops to check every possible pair of numbers, resulting in an $O(n^2)$ time complexity. However, a hash map can optimize this to $O(n)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimized algorithm works as follows: iterate through the array once. For each element `num`, calculate its required complement, `complement = target - num`. Then, check if `complement` already exists in the hash map. \n",
    "* If it does, we have found our pair.\n",
    "* If it does not, add the current element `num` and its index to the hash map and proceed to the next element.\n",
    "\n",
    "This works because by the time we are at index `i`, our hash map contains all the elements seen at indices `0` through `i-1`. The lookup for the complement is an $O(1)$ operation on average, and we only pass through the array once, yielding a total time complexity of $O(n)$."
