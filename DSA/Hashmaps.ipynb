    "## 2.1 🚀 The Most Important Data Structure: Hash Maps\n",
    "\n",
    "In the landscape of data structures, the **Hash Map**—known as a `dictionary` in Python—stands out as arguably the most critical tool for a software engineer, particularly in the context of coding interviews. Its prevalence stems from a single, powerful capability: the ability to perform average-time **$O(1)$ complexity for lookups, insertions, and deletions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This constant-time performance allows for the creation of highly efficient algorithms that would otherwise be sluggish. Many brute-force solutions with quadratic complexity, such as $O(n^2)$, can often be optimized to linear time, $O(n)$, by the clever application of a hash map. This optimization is not just an incremental improvement; it is a fundamental shift in efficiency that separates a non-viable solution from a production-ready one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, it is essential to internalize the following critical thinking question. It should be the first thing you ask yourself when aiming to optimize a slow algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **If you are ever stuck on an $O(n^2)$ solution, ask yourself: 'Can a hash map help?'**"

    "## 2.2 ⚙️ Under the Hood: How Hashing Works\n",
    "\n",
    "To wield hash maps effectively, it is crucial to understand their internal mechanics. A hash map is a generalization of a standard array. While an array uses an integer index to access an element, a hash map allows you to use a key of almost any type (e.g., a string, a number, or a tuple) to find its corresponding value. This is achieved through three core components:"

    "### Hash Function\n",
    "A hash function is a mathematical function that takes a key as input and deterministically produces an integer output. This integer is the \"hash code.\" In the context of a hash map, this hash code is then mapped to an index within the underlying array.\n",
    "$$ \\text{index} = \\text{hash}(\\text{key}) \\pmod{M} $$\n",
    "Where $M$ is the size of the underlying array. A good hash function distributes keys uniformly across the available indices to minimize collisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Buckets\n",
    "The underlying data store for a hash map is an array. Each slot in this array is called a **bucket**. The index calculated by the hash function determines which bucket a key-value pair should be placed in.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Collision Resolution\n",
    "A **hash collision** occurs when two distinct keys produce the same hash code, and thus map to the same bucket index. Since two items cannot occupy the same single slot, a strategy is needed to handle this. The most common method is **Chaining**.\n",
    "\n",
    "With chaining, each bucket, instead of holding a single value, holds a pointer to another data structure, typically a linked list. If multiple keys map to the same bucket, their key-value pairs are simply appended to the linked list at that index. When retrieving a value, the hash map first finds the correct bucket and then traverses the linked list, comparing the given key with the keys stored in the list until a match is found."

    "- **Iteration (`.keys()`, `.values()`, `.items()`)**: These methods provide views for iterating over the dictionary's keys, values, or key-value pairs, respectively. Using `for key, value in my_dict.items():` is the standard for iterating over both simultaneously."

    "\n",
    "The $O(1)$ lookup capability of a hash map makes it exceptionally well-suited for problems that involve searching for items. This includes detecting duplicates, finding pairs that satisfy a specific condition, or, more generally, checking for the existence of an element in a collection.\n",
    "\n",

    "A naive, brute-force approach would use nested loops to check every possible pair of numbers, resulting in an $O(n^2)$ time complexity. However, a hash map can optimize this to $O(n)$.\n",

    "For a problem like \"Group Anagrams,\" where we group words like \"eat\" and \"tea\", two primary strategies exist for creating a canonical key:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Sorted String (Intuitive, Less Performant)**: The most intuitive key is the sorted version of the string (e.g., `\"eat\"` becomes `\"aet\"`). While correct, this involves an $O(K \\log K)$ sorting operation for every string of length $K$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Character Count Array (Optimal)**: A more performant key is a tuple representing the frequency of each character. For lowercase English letters, this would be a 26-element tuple where each index corresponds to a letter `a-z`. For `\"eat\"`, the key would be `(1, 0, 0, 0, 1, ..., 1, ...)`. This key can be generated in $O(K)$ time, as it only requires a single pass over the string. This makes it the superior choice for performance."

    "\n",
    "**LeetCode 49: Group Anagrams**\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an array of strings `strs`, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.\n",
    "\n",
    "An **Anagram** is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: strs = [\"eat\",\"tea\",\"tan\",\"ate\",\"nat\",\"bat\"]\n",
    "Output: [[\"bat\"],[\"nat\",\"tan\"],[\"ate\",\"eat\",\"tea\"]]\n",

    "### Problem Identification & Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Identify the Pattern**: The problem asks us to **\"group\"** items. Following our identification guide, this immediately signals the \"Grouping & Counting\" pattern, making a hash map the right data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Devise a Key**: We need a canonical representation for anagrams. As discussed, the optimal key is a character count tuple. The words \"eat\" and \"tea\" are anagrams because they both contain exactly one 'a', one 'e', and one 't'. We represent this signature as a 26-element tuple, which is immutable and thus a perfect hash map key.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Choose the Right Tool**: Since we are grouping strings into lists, `collections.defaultdict(list)` is the ideal tool. It automatically handles the creation of a new list for any new character-count key we encounter."

    "### Step-by-Step Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimal algorithm is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Initialize an empty `defaultdict(list)` named `anagram_map`.\n",
    "2.  Iterate through each `word` in the input list `strs`.\n",
    "3.  For each `word`, create a frequency array, `count`, of 26 zeros.\n",
    "4.  Iterate through each character `c` of the `word`. For each character, increment the appropriate index in the `count` array (e.g., `count[ord(c) - ord('a')] += 1`).\n",
    "5.  Once the `word` is fully processed, convert the `count` list into a `tuple`. This makes it immutable and thus hashable.\n",
    "6.  Use this count-tuple as the key to access `anagram_map` and append the original `word` to the list at that key.\n",
    "7.  After the loop finishes, the values of `anagram_map` are the lists of grouped anagrams. Return these values."
