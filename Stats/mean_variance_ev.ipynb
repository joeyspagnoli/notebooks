    "| **Population Mean** ($\\mu$) | $\\mu = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i}{N}$ | N/A | This is the true, fixed average of the entire population. It's the value that the **Sample Mean** ($\\bar{x}$) aims to estimate. It's also the **Expected Value** ($E[X]$) for a random variable drawn from the population. |\n",
    "| **Sample Mean** ($\\bar{x}$) | $\\bar{x} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i}{n}$ | N/A | The average of a sample. It's the primary unbiased estimator for the **Population Mean** ($\\mu$). It is used to calculate the **Sample Variance** ($s^2$). |\n",
    "| **Expected Value** ($E[X]$) | $E[X] = \\sum x \\cdot P(x)$ | For a discrete uniform distribution (like a dice roll), this simplifies to the **Population Mean** formula. | Conceptually, it's the long-run average of a random variable. For a population dataset, $E[X]$ is identical to $\\mu$. |\n",
    "| **Population Variance** ($\\sigma^2$) | $\\sigma^2 = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \\mu)^2}{N}$ | $\\sigma^2 = \\frac{\\sum x^2 - (\\sum x)^2/N}{N} = E[X^2] - (E[X])^2$ | Measures the true spread of the entire population around the **Population Mean** ($\\mu$). The square root of this is the **Standard Deviation** ($\\sigma$). |\n",
    "| **Sample Variance** ($s^2$) | $s^2 = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2}{n-1}$ | $s^2 = \\frac{\\sum x^2 - (\\sum x)^2/n}{n-1}$ | The best unbiased estimator for the **Population Variance** ($\\sigma^2$). It uses the **Sample Mean** ($\\bar{x}$) in its calculation. The $n-1$ denominator (Bessel's correction) corrects for the bias of using $\\bar{x}$ instead of the unknown $\\mu$. |\n",
    "| **Standard Deviation** ($\\sigma$, $s$) | $\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\sigma^2}$ <br> $s = \\sqrt{s^2}$ | N/A | It is the square root of the corresponding variance ($\\sigma^2$ or $s^2$). It brings the measure of spread back into the original units of the data, making it more interpretable than variance. |"
